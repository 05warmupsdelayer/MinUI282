Installing

PREFACE

On devices that support two SD cards (eg. RG35XX) I will use the name "TF1" to refer to the card that goes into slot one of the device. All other instances of "SD card" or "primary card" refer to the card that goes into the second slot or to the sole SD card of devices that only support a single card. To get the most out of MinUI on devices that support two SD cards you should install MinUI on the second card.

Copy all the folders from this zip file to the root of your primary card.

----------------------------------------
Updating

This extras zip file is included with every release, regardless of whether its contents has changed or not. Refer to the release notes to see what, if anything, was added or changed and copy just the desired updated pak(s) to the corresponding device folder in the Emus or Tools folders (eg. /Emus/trimuismart or /Tools/rgb30)
