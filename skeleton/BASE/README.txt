INCOMPLETE ROUGH DRAFT

Installing

PREFACE

MinUI has two essential parts: an installer/updater zip archive and a platform-specific "bootstrap" file or folder.

On devices that support two SD cards (eg. RG35XX) I will use the name "TF1" to refer to the card that goes into slot one of the device. All other instances of "SD card" or "primary card" refer to the card that goes into the second slot or to the sole SD card of devices that only support a single card. To get the most out of MinUI, on devices that support two SD cards you should install MinUI on the second card.

The primary card should be a reputable brand and freshly formatted as FAT32.

RG35XX

MinUI is meant to be installed over a fresh copy of the stock Anbernic firmware. You can use the stock TF1 card, reports of its poor quality are greatly exaggerated and, as long as you are using the recommended two card setup, no userdata is stored on it. The TF2 card should be formatted FAT32.

Copy "dmenu.bin" to the root of the MISC partition of the TF1 card. Copy "MinUI.zip" (without unzipping) to the root of the TF2 card.

MIYOO MINI

Copy the "miyoo" folder and "MinUI.zip" (without unzipping) to the root of the SD card.

Updating

RG35XX

Copy "MinUI.zip" (without unzipping) to the root of the TF2 card.

MIYOO MINI

Copy "MinUI.zip" (without unzipping) to the root of the SD card.
