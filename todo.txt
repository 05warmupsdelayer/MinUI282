try inlining other functions
	can I dereference the renderer pointer for more speed? (or is the compiler already doing that?)

known issues
	rg35xx: has quicksave menu item because BUTTON_POWER==SDLK_UNKNOWN
	trimuismart: faux rtc isn't implemented yet
	trimuismart: debug hud isn't available 
	trimuismart: low battery overlay isn't implemented yet
	miyoomini: prevent tearing strict introduces tearing :sob:
	miyoomini: audio popping between launches
	miyoomini: low battery overlay isn't implemented yet
	miyoominiplus: doesn't always display installing/updating message

rg35xx
	patch sdl to give powerbutton a proper keysym
	how to handle updating on mini and missing TF1 updates as a result?
		could I write the version to the .minstalled file
		if it doesn't match the current one run the installer
		trimui smart has a similar issue now
			the bootstrap folder updates /etc/main

all
	cores
		vb slow (smart)
			fixed by std=gnu99?
		fake08 crashes when resuming states (all)
			segfault after opening audio state?
			or an issue with rotated scaling?
			or a core issue
	minarch
		some aspect scaling isn't working correctly
			fceumm is ending up not-quite-native but also not the full aspect ratio
				something to do with PAGE_SIZE limitations?
			I think I should redo both scaler selectors
		doesn't pickup on core setting ratio changes? eg. fceumm
		support missing buttons with MENU+BUTTON? (smart)
	api
		GFX_blitDebug(text,x,y)?
			simple for everything but trimuismart with its -90Â° screen
	minui
		shows games in alt collated folders even if the alt pak isn't present...
			not sure how that's possible...
	add a "res" (or "many"?) folder 
		for install/update and charging gfx?
	show
	say
	confirm
	
smart
	what if led always flashed while sleeping (once the quicksave is created, then you know it's safe to poweroff)
		we don't have a hook into POW_fauxSleep to do that...unless we thread it 
			but that goes against the idea of an idle sleep state :sweat_smile:
	optimize text doesn't work with a rotated surface
		what if I only did rotation before scaling if dimensions are larger than fixed size?
	
	sync rtc
		also sync rtc when saving (game or state) in minarch?
		what happens when two device you're swapping the sd card between disagree on datetime?
			what does that do to games that expect an RTC?
	keymon
		battery/usb monitoring
			might be fine where it is
	update default.cfg that include bindings for L2/R2?
	battery overlay

miyoomini
	prevent tearing modes are in conflict
		lenient has no tearing, flickering settings overlay
		strict has tearing, flicker-free settings overlay
	battery overlay
	update tearing defaults to strict for
		gb
		gbc
		gba
		md
		???

miniplus
	installing/updating message takes a while to appear (if it ever does)
	
	audio fix isn't working
		audio is working but it pops between launches
		not muting when volume hits 0
		is it because I'm using MI_AO_* functions instead of ioctls?


rg35xx/install and miyoomini/install have png/bmp versions of the same files
	as do miyoomini/dat/ and rg35xx/ramdisk/

I think I might want to checkout a fresh copy of union-minui create a union branch delete everything in it and copy this into it (try as a single commit first and see how smart it is about moving things versus a delete and an add commit)
no, rename and archive the original union (union-prototype) and rename this to just union

README

have a verbose version and a short list version

1. makefile routes requests through makefile.toolchain
2. which clones the toolchain repo if necessary and
3. spins up a docker to run workspace/makefile build for each/the target platform
4. which builds commone elfs and punts to workspace/PLATFORM/makefile
5. which builds unique platform elfs

there's more to this now (eg. PLATFORM/makefile.copy)

potential mm+ identifier
	/customer/app/axp_test exists
	/miyoo354 instead of /miyoo

replace 
	git clone repo && cd repo && git checkout branch 
with
	git clone --depth 1 --branch branch repo
note: doesn't work with commits only branches
