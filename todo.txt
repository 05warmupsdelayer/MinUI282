	minarch
		some aspect scaling isn't working correctly
			fceumm is ending up not-quite-native but also not the full aspect ratio
				something to do with PAGE_SIZE limitations?
			I think I should redo both scaler selectors
		doesn't pickup on core setting ratio changes? eg. fceumm
		support missing buttons with MENU+BUTTON? (smart)
	api
		GFX_blitDebug(text,x,y)?
			simple for everything but trimuismart with its -90Â° screen
	minui
		shows games in alt collated folders even if the alt pak isn't present...
			not sure how that's possible...
	promote .userdata/arm-480 to /States?
		might depend on how the Model S fairs
	add a "res" (or "many"?) folder 
		for install/update and charging gfx?
	show
	say
	confirm
	
smart
	quicksave!
		currently shows message when waking from sleep
	
	optimize text doesn't work with a rotated surface
		what if I only did rotation before scaling if dimensions are larger than fixed size?
	hardware button lables need updating (eg. (POWER) SLEEP -> L+R+MENU)
	sync rtc
		also sync rtc when saving (game or state) in minarch?
		what happens when two device you're swapping the sd card between disagree on datetime?
			what does that do to games that expect an RTC?
	keymon
		battery/usb monitoring
			might be fine where it is
	update default.cfg that include bindings for L2/R2?
	battery overlay
	figure out
		quicksave (autoresume already works)
			add as last item to Options?

miyoomini
	battery overlay
	update tearing defaults to strict for
		gb
		gbc
		gba
		md
		???

rg35xx
	how to handle updating on mini and missing TF1 updates as a result?
		could I write the version to the .minstalled file
		if it doesn't match the current one run the installer
		trimui smart has a similar issue now
			the bootstrap folder updates /etc/main



rg35xx/install and miyoomini/install have png/bmp versions of the same files
	as do miyoomini/dat/ and rg35xx/ramdisk/

I think I might want to checkout a fresh copy of union-minui create a union branch delete everything in it and copy this into it (try as a single commit first and see how smart it is about moving things versus a delete and an add commit)
no, rename and archive the original union (union-prototype) and rename this to just union

README

have a verbose version and a short list version

1. makefile routes requests through makefile.toolchain
2. which clones the toolchain repo if necessary and
3. spins up a docker to run workspace/makefile build for each/the target platform
4. which builds commone elfs and punts to workspace/PLATFORM/makefile
5. which builds unique platform elfs

there's more to this now (eg. PLATFORM/makefile.copy)
