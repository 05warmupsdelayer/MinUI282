both
	add SHARED_TAG, cpu-yres eg. arm-480

miyoomini
	batmon isn't launching anymore?
	update tearing defaults to strict for
		gb
		gbc
		gba
		md
		???

rg35xx (actually probably both)
	MENU+UP shortcut binding weirdness (disappears after restart, only MENU remains bound?)
		probably has something to do with UP being the first (0) button



replace 
	git clone repo && cd repo && git checkout branch 
with
	git clone --depth 1 --branch branch repo
note: doesn't work with commits only branches

shows games in alt collated folders even if the alt pak isn't present...

rg35xx/install and miyoomini/install have png/bmp versions of the same files

what if MinUI.zip was actually inside a folder?
	might eliminate confusion about whether it needs to be unzipped or not...
	random installer assets could be put in there too? :thinking:

I think I might want to checkout a fresh copy of union-minui create a union branch delete everything in it and copy this into it (try as a single commit first and see how smart it is about moving things versus a delete and an add commit)

README

have a verbose version and a short list version

1. makefile routes requests through makefile.toolchain
2. which clones the toolchain repo if necessary and
3. spins up a docker to run workspace/makefile build for each/the target platform
4. which builds commone elfs and punts to workspace/PLATFORM/makefile
5. which builds unique platform elfs


TODO: cores and extras bundle should probably be included from a platform-specific makefile.bundle since not every device will support the same cores
TODO: 

had a detour because it was using an ancient rg35xx-toolchain because the union-rg35xx-toolchain was creating rg35xx-toolchain-new :facepalm:

be sure to note libretro-common hash in commits.txt too

restore msettings

each platform will have its own cores folder
	or what if it defined cores and contained the patches
	but there remained one
	unique patches (primarily makefile)
	unique supported cores?
TODO: may run into issues building cores for multiple platforms in the same build folder...

potential mm+ identifier
	/customer/app/axp_test exists
	/miyoo354 instead of /miyoo
