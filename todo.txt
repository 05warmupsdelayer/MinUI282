all
	minarch
		support missing buttons with MENU+BUTTON?
	promote .userdata/arm-480 to /States?
		might depend on how the Model S fairs
	hardware button lables need updating (eg. (POWER) SLEEP -> L+R+MENU)
	add a res (or many?) folder 
		for install/update and charging gfx?
	show
	say
	confirm

smart
	implement eggs version of
		brightness
	keymon
		battery/usb monitoring

		scaling
		tearing

minui
	shows games in alt collated folders even if the alt pak isn't present...
		not sure how that's possible...



rg35xx/install and miyoomini/install have png/bmp versions of the same files
	as do miyoomini/dat/ and rg35xx/ramdisk/

I think I might want to checkout a fresh copy of union-minui create a union branch delete everything in it and copy this into it (try as a single commit first and see how smart it is about moving things versus a delete and an add commit)
no, rename and archive the original union (union-prototype) and rename this to just union

README

have a verbose version and a short list version

1. makefile routes requests through makefile.toolchain
2. which clones the toolchain repo if necessary and
3. spins up a docker to run workspace/makefile build for each/the target platform
4. which builds commone elfs and punts to workspace/PLATFORM/makefile
5. which builds unique platform elfs

there's more to this now (eg. PLATFORM/makefile.copy)
