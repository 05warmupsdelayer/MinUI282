next
	figure out what needs to be done for an initial release
		readmes?
		trimui smart
			good enough to go
		miyoo mini
			good enough to go
		rg35xx
			good to go
	
	rgb30: ELLOS + MinUI
		figure out how to handle resolution switch of hdmi out
	
	all: standardize on using extension for shell scripts
		primarily for quicklook in Finder :sweat_smile:
	
	minarch: add Crop Overscan 
		Native already does this now but only if native is larger than screen...
	minarch: add halign and valign 
		specifically for rgb30
	
	trimui: scaling (see DE test)
	
	rg353: switch to JELOS root?
		lots of issues (see JELOS-docker/ideas.txt)
	rg353: core patch files have whitespace issues
	rg353: scaling (hw?)
	rg353: building with everything else
	
known issues
	all: pokemini doesn't restore audio when resuming from minui (at least on nano and 35xx)
		add all/cores/patches/core/* patches
		this won't work because the number of defer frames varies by platform
		actually the number doesn't vary? wth
		bumped defer from 36 to 40 for trimui
	all: not convinced fixed aspect scaling corrects for screen aspect correctly
	
	miyoomini: prevent tearing strict introduces tearing :sob:
	miyoomini: debug/battery overlay isn't implemented yet
	
	trimuismart: debug/battery overlay isn't available/implemented yet
	
	trimui: hw scaling isn't implemented yet
	trimui: debug/battery overlay isn't implemented yet
	
	rg353: double-buffered drawing isn't implemented yet (tearing)
	rg353: non-integer scaling isn't implemented yet
	rg353: clock always resets to gmt with wifi enabled
	
	nano: binding MENU+button in menu sleeps device (also doesn't bind MENU+button only button)

sf2000
	hahahahahahaha no.

nano
	the lack of shared SD card support is a big downer
		abandon this platform?
		have I documented the boot process or how to create the modified firmware image?
	L+R and d-pad to offset cropped "scaling"?
	keep an eye out for a 60fps fix
		https://github.com/DrUm78/linux/tags
		I think I got it (though I coudln't tell it wasn't running 60fps before so...)
		this might be running worse after the fix...
	test nano MinUI SD in all other (fully) supported devices
		no joy :sob:
		can the boot partition be hidden from other devices?
		or can I change the boot order to prioritize nand over sd?
	minarch
		cores
			sfc - not great, non-plus is better but still struggles with sfx chip games like SF or YI
			psx?
		patches
	hardware scaling
		no? but screen is so tiny, relative ppi so high, it might not matter
	is overclocking possible?
		no?
	installer/updater
		(build into /etc/rcS logic)

all
	minarch
		doesn't pickup on core setting ratio changes? eg. fceumm
		add vertical and horizontal screen alignment to frontend options?
		prevent MENU+button from triggering button
		prevent binding same MENU+button to control and shortcut at same time
			reset the newer input to None and show a message, ideal something like:
				MENU+<button> is already bound to (<name> shortcut|<name> control)
	clock
		factor in timezone offset?
	simple progress animation for installing/updating
		launch as a daemon with &
		draws in a corner
		kill after install/update complete
		if it's circular we don't even need to worry about rotation :sweat_smile:
	main makefile
		targets have too many dependencies
	cores
		add optional per core patch folder
			currently looks for a global one in all/cores
	api
		GFX_blitDebug(text,x,y)?
			simple for everything but trimuismart with its -90Â° screen
	minui
		info window vertical centering is off on 1x devices
		support multiple tags in folder name?
			eg. Super Nintendo (SFC,SFCALT)
			where SFX.pak is only present on higher power systems and
			SFCALT.pak is an older core meant for lower power systems
			states will not be compatible because of the different core but...
		shows games in alt collated folders even if the alt pak isn't present...
			not sure how that's possible...
		alt tag is getting truncated, should be added after truncation
	add a "res" (or "many"?) folder 
		for install/update and charging gfx?
	show
	say
	confirm

trimui
	overclock
		crashy
	scaling
	overlay
	create core patches
	
	cores
		picodrive
			doesn't recover from quicksave reliably...
		snes9x2005_plus 
			no sound
		snes9x2005
			only running at ~45fps
			frameskip of 1 is probably necessary but 2005 doesn't have that option
			will need to patch
		gpsp
			ffiv requires manual frameskip of 1 to not chug on mode7-like bits
	
rg353
	had to add -flto to build flags to get minui+clock to build (possibly because of long ago scaler changes?)
	toolchain: patch buildroot SDL for POWER/PLUS/MINUS (see rg35xx)
	would love to get adbd working...
	overclocking
	additional cores
	rumble
	vsync
		appears to work
		lets setup our own double buffer so we can use it
	get latest MinUI/launch.sh from SD card

smart
	cores
		supa starfox perf bad
		pcsx freeze opening menu tekken 3
	battery/debug overlay

miyoomini
	separate settings file for mini and plus?
	
	prevent tearing modes are in conflict
		lenient has no tearing, flickering settings overlay
		strict has tearing, flicker-free settings overlay
	battery overlay
	update tearing defaults to strict for
		gba
		md
		???

miniplus
	-
	
rg35xx
	how to handle updating on mini and missing TF1 updates as a result?
		could I write the version to the .minstalled file
		if it doesn't match the current one run the installer
		trimui smart has a similar issue now
			the bootstrap folder updates /etc/main


rg35xx/install and miyoomini/install have png/bmp versions of the same files
	as do miyoomini/dat/ and rg35xx/ramdisk/

---

FIXME: main makefile is a brittle mess
	each platform has its own default cores and extras
	so it's a tangle

---

1. makefile routes requests through makefile.toolchain
2. which clones the toolchain repo if necessary and
3. spins up a docker to run workspace/makefile build for each/the target platform
4. which builds commone elfs and punts to workspace/PLATFORM/makefile
5. which builds unique platform elfs

there's more to this now (eg. PLATFORM/makefile.copy)

---

potential mm+ identifier
	/customer/app/axp_test exists
	/miyoo354 instead of /miyoo

replace 
	git clone repo && cd repo && git checkout branch 
with
	git clone --depth 1 --branch branch repo
note: doesn't work with commits only branches
