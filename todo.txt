get the mini side of the build process set up
	libmsettings!

msettings


I think I might want to checkout a fresh copy of union-minui create a union branch delete everything in it and copy this into it (try as a single commit first and see how smart it is about moving things versus a delete and an add commit)



1. makefile routes requests through makefile.toolchain
2. which clones the toolchain repo if necessary and
3. spins up a docker to run workspace/makefile build for each/the target platform
4. which builds commone elfs and punts to workspace/PLATFORM/makefile
5. which builds unique platform elfs


TODO: cores and extras bundle should probably be included from a platform-specific makefile.bundle since not every device will support the same cores
TODO: 

had a detour because it was using an ancient rg35xx-toolchain because the union-rg35xx-toolchain was creating rg35xx-toolchain-new :facepalm:

question
	does libsettings need to be separate if every app is build with api.c?
	it's already built, don't fuck with it


be sure to note libretro-common hash in commits.txt too

restore msettings

each platform will have its own cores folder
	or what if it defined cores and contained the patches
	but there remained one
	unique patches (primarily makefile)
	unique supported cores?
TODO: may run into issues building cores for multiple platforms in the same build folder...

potential mm+ identifier
	/customer/app/axp_test exists
	/miyoo354 instead of /miyoo
