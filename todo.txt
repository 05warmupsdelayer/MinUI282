1. makefile routes requests through makefile.toolchain
2. which clones the toolchain repo if necessary and
3. spins up a docker to run workspace/makefile build for each/the target platform
4. which builds commone elfs and punts to workspace/PLATFORM/makefile
5. which builds unique platform elfs



question
	does libsettings need to be separate if every app is build with api.c?
	it's already built, don't fuck with it


be sure to note libretro-common hash in commits.txt too

restore msettings

each platform will have its own cores folder
	or what if it defined cores and contained the patches
	but there remained one
	unique patches (primarily makefile)
	unique supported cores?
TODO: may run into issues building cores for multiple platforms in the same build folder...

potential mm+ identifier
	/customer/app/axp_test exists
	/miyoo354 instead of /miyoo
