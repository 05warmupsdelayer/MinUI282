next
	test new MOSS image
	full tests
		install on each device
		update on each device

	smartpro
		can't detect headphone state at boot?
		make leds throb when sleeping?

	user reported
		random reports of minui not booting reliably 
			first smart
			then rgb30
			can't reproduce
		
		install on rg35xx, install on smart doesn't work
			but smart to rg35xx does
		rgb30 doesn't restore brightness
			it libmsettings does but the os isn't listening?
			only affected max brightness as far as I can tell
	add race
		+ rgb30
		- others

	move PLAT_isOnline() into PWR_* formally
	moss: build lib32 to try to fix snes9x save state compatibility
		first attempt did not go well :sweat_smile:
			
	all
		fake-08 it looks like save states might have been fixed
			14243c0
			save states in general are wonky, eg.
				load a Celeste state in later levels with pink sky
				then load a state from earlier levels, the sky should
				be black but instead it's pink like a later level
		
		pull latest gpsp (fixes for long standing problem games I guess?)
			nope, breaks save state compatibility
			oddly it appears to be fixed on a branch? https://github.com/libretro/gpsp/commit/8745bf3d8fbb708db13bb726e5d89a6832f74d73
			but it looks like the save state format has been updated 2 more times since then so using that commit as a patch probably won't work
			f4e65d15 is known safe
			broken
				f0bacff
				bcd062e
			works!
				1d1c719
	
	minarch:
		crop save state pillar/letter-boxing?
	
	build datetime disconnect
		build products on macos use local time
		build products in dockers use gmt
			
	m17
		SDL2 accelerated rendering fixes frame issues
		but scaling is awful
	
	rgb30
		copy over SDL2 changes from tg5040
			didn't work
		figure out why power suspends the device after MOSS install
			it appears to reboot but it only stops suspending after a manual reboot
			fewt has a fix?
				https://github.com/JustEnoughLinuxOS/distribution/pull/2195/files#diff-719d790f2d3c1d5a0884ae9eb69fb77956fcaaae235282acb6e6817339f35105

		do some benchmarking to see where the slowdown is coming from
			the software scaler?
			the core?
			minarch?
			sdl12-compat?
			
		aspect scaling has garbage at bottom in VB
			is this an librga thing?
			
		performance issues (both frame rate and audio clipping)
			fceuum 
			picodrive
			vb
			pcsx
			could this have anything to do with the performance versus userspace governor?
				no
			I think it's caused by the forced vsync in sdl2 (still most likely)
				or fullscreen blitting? possibly
		debug overlay drawing glitches
	
	trimui: scaling (see DE test)
		
known issues
	all: not convinced fixed aspect scaling corrects for screen aspect correctly
	all: race core (NGP/C.pak) doesn't restore audio state correctly
	
	miyoomini: debug/battery overlay isn't implemented yet
	
	trimuismart: debug/battery overlay isn't available/implemented yet
	
	trimui: hw scaling isn't implemented yet
	trimui: debug/battery overlay isn't implemented yet
	
	nano: says it can bind MENU+button for shortcuts, it can't
	rgb30: light crackling in some cores (eg. fceumm and snes9x2005_plus)
	rgb30: hdmi tearing near the top of the screen
		this seems to be limited to gambatte? confirm?

all
	minarch
		GFX_blitMessage() screen w/h is 0,0 for some reason
		doesn't pickup on core setting ratio changes? eg. fceumm
		prevent MENU+button from triggering button
		prevent binding same MENU+button to control and shortcut at same time
			reset the newer input to None and show a message, ideal something like:
				MENU+<button> is already bound to (<name> shortcut|<name> control)
	clock
		factor in timezone offset?
	simple progress animation for installing/updating
		launch as a daemon with &
		draws in a corner
		kill after install/update complete
		if it's circular we don't even need to worry about rotation :sweat_smile:
	main makefile
		targets have too many dependencies
	cores
		add optional per core patch folder
			currently looks for a global one in all/cores
	api
		GFX_blitDebug(text,x,y)?
			simple for everything but trimuismart with its -90Â° screen
	minui
		support multiple tags in folder name?
			eg. Super Nintendo (SFC,SFCALT)
			where SFX.pak is only present on higher power systems and
			SFCALT.pak is an older core meant for lower power systems
			states will not be compatible because of the different core but...
		shows games in alt collated folders even if the alt pak isn't present...
			not sure how that's possible...
		alt tag is getting truncated, should be added after truncation
	add a "res" (or "many"?) folder 
		for install/update and charging gfx?
	show
	say
	confirm

smart
	cores
		supa starfox perf bad

miyoomini
	separate settings file for mini and plus?
	battery overlay

miniplus
	-
	
rg35xx
	overclock.elf with userspace versus performance
		performance should be slower because it will max out to the max defined scaling frequency
		userspace should accept the specific scaling frequency
		re: NDS.pak
		
		XQuader figured out that CPUs are unlocked with performance but not userspace
			the following will unlock them:
				echo 0xf > /sys/devices/system/cpu/autoplug/plug_mask
				echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online
				echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu2/online
				echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu3/online
			but using performance instead of userspace has the same result so maybe just use that
				as long as it doesn't kill battery life?
			turns oout this was discovered back in may by another user:
				https://www.reddit.com/r/RG35XX/comments/13rtrqb/minuis_snes_performance/
				https://github.com/shauninman/MinUI-Legacy-RG35XX/compare/main...zoli0726:union-minui:main
				seems like this is sufficient to unlock the improved performance
					echo 0xF > /sys/devices/system/cpu/autoplug/plug_mask
					though I'm not sure I'm observing a difference...(at least when applying over adb)
		
	charging screen isn't working for someone on RH discord
	how to handle updating on mini and missing TF1 updates as a result?
		could I write the version to the .minstalled file
		if it doesn't match the current one run the installer
		trimui smart has a similar issue now
			the bootstrap folder updates /etc/main

nano
	the lack of shared SD card support is a big downer
		abandon this platform?
		have I documented the boot process or how to create the modified firmware image?
	L+R and d-pad to offset cropped "scaling"?
	keep an eye out for a 60fps fix
		https://github.com/DrUm78/linux/tags
		I think I got it (though I coudln't tell it wasn't running 60fps before so...)
		this might be running worse after the fix...
	test nano MinUI SD in all other (fully) supported devices
		no joy :sob:
		can the boot partition be hidden from other devices?
		or can I change the boot order to prioritize nand over sd?
	minarch
		cores
			sfc - not great, non-plus is better but still struggles with sfx chip games like SF or YI
			psx?
		patches
	hardware scaling
		no? but screen is so tiny, relative ppi so high, it might not matter
	is overclocking possible?
		no?
	installer/updater
		(build into /etc/rcS logic)

trimui
	overclock
		crashy
	scaling
	overlay
	create core patches
	
	cores
		picodrive
			doesn't recover from quicksave reliably...
		snes9x2005_plus 
			no sound
		snes9x2005
			only running at ~45fps
			frameskip of 1 is probably necessary but 2005 doesn't have that option
			will need to patch
		gpsp
			ffiv requires manual frameskip of 1 to not chug on mode7-like bits
	
rg353
	had to add -flto to build flags to get minui+clock to build (possibly because of long ago scaler changes?)
	toolchain: patch buildroot SDL for POWER/PLUS/MINUS (see rg35xx)
	would love to get adbd working...
	overclocking
	additional cores
	rumble
	vsync
		appears to work
		lets setup our own double buffer so we can use it

rg35xx/install and miyoomini/install have png/bmp versions of the same files
	as do miyoomini/dat/ and rg35xx/ramdisk/

sf2000
	hahahahahahaha no.

FIXME: main makefile is a brittle mess
	each platform has its own default cores and extras
	so it's a tangle

---

1. makefile routes requests through makefile.toolchain
2. which clones the toolchain repo if necessary and
3. spins up a docker to run workspace/makefile build for each/the target platform
4. which builds commone elfs and punts to workspace/PLATFORM/makefile
5. which builds unique platform elfs

there's more to this now (eg. PLATFORM/makefile.copy)

---

potential mm+ identifier
	/customer/app/axp_test exists
	/miyoo354 instead of /miyoo

replace 
	git clone repo && cd repo && git checkout branch 
with
	git clone --depth 1 --branch branch repo
note: doesn't work with commits only branches
